# ts-file-server
A simple file server in express that serves a file-tree structure or a file it self

Usage:
- clone repo: ```git clone https://github.com/hussedev/ts-file-server.git```
- install dependencies: ```npm install```
- run the server: ```npm start```

The server will listen on http://localhost:3002 by default

I created a file browser for this server, you can find it on this repo: https://github.com/hussedev/ts-file-tree.git
